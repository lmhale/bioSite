<div class="one">Elliot grew up in the not so bustling state of Oklahoma. The oldest of three, Elliot was a precocious and creative child with an imagination that could put Doctor Seuss to shame. Elliot developed a strong since of right and wrong from his parents, who he considers to be thoughtful and fair. His entrenched desire to travel spurs from family summer road trips that left almost no major U.S. city or landmark unturned. A solid foundation of love and family, Elliot was set up to succeed and thrive.  </div>

  <div class="2">Elliot always had a bizarre fascination with  weather and natural disasters. Oklahoma is prime real estate for tornado  activity, nestled right in the center of an infamous zone known as &ldquo;tornado  alley.&rdquo; Spring time for some people means the start of a beloved sport, or  maybe the return to gardening, for Elliot it always meant storm season. Winter  would end and all those close to Elliot would be subject to a constant barrage  of information about the Fujita Scale and wind speeds. Though Oklahoma made  studying tornadoes easy, Elliot did not discriminate against other phenomena.  He used to make his siblings play a game that involved building a city of  blocks on books, and then simulate an earthquake by shaking the books as if  they were tectonic plates. What may seem like a purely morbid fascination for  disasters, Elliot truly respected the power of Mother Nature. He understood the  devastation that these disasters could bring to people&rsquo;s lives, and so he  received his master&rsquo;s degree in emergency management</div>

<div class="3">After graduating from the University of Oklahoma, Elliot embarked on a journey with the peace core that would fundamentally change him. Living in a Ger (basically a glorified tent) for a year in temperatures as low as -30 degrees, his resilience was tested. He chopped his own wood, avoided vicious stray dogs, and found out what he was made of. But the land of the big blue sky was more than its hardships. The sweeping landscapes were beautiful, teaching English to young children was rewarding, and the experience of living in a country and culture drastically different from his own gave him a new lease on life. </div>

  <p>Elliot always knew he wanted  to be a working professional in a big city, and New York had called to him for  quite some time. At 24 years old he took the plunge and made New York City his  new home. Even with a master&rsquo;s and a year in the peace core, finding work was  difficult, and he spent a year in financial uncertainty. Eventually, he landed  a job in advertising and has been climbing the corporate later ever since. He  describes his current stage of life as one of the happiest he&rsquo;s ever been in.  He can breathe easy with his professional fulfillment and loving com</p>
